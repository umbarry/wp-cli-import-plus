## Using

This package implements the following command:

	 wp import-plus <file> [--extra-categories=<IDs>] [--extra-tags=<slugs>] [--extra-custom-terms-taxonomy=<taxonomy-name>] [--extra-custom-terms=<IDs/slugs>] [--extra-post-meta-keys=<meta-keys>] [--extra-post-meta-values=<meta-values>] [--skip-categories] [--skip-tags] [--authors=<authors>] [--skip=<data-type>]

**OPTIONS**

	<file>
		Path to one or more valid WXR files for importing. Directories are also accepted.
		
	[--extra-categories=<IDs>]
	 Comma-separated list of categories IDs to associate to each imported post.

	 Comma-separated list of post_tag slugs to associate to each imported post.
	 
	[--extra-custom-terms-taxonomy=<taxonomy-name>]
	 The taxonomy of the extra terms to associate to each imported post. 
	 If not set the extra-custom-terms parameter will be ignored.
	 
	[--extra-custom-terms=<IDs/slugs>]
	 Comma-separated list of terms to associate to each imported post. 
	 If you want to enter terms of a hierarchical taxonomy like
	 categories, then use IDs. If you want to add non-hierarchical terms like tags, 
	 then use names. The parameter will be ignored if extra-custom-terms-taxonomy isn't set.
     
    [--extra-post-meta-keys=<meta-keys>]
     Comma-separated list of post-meta keys to associate to each imported post.

     The values will be assigned respectively in the same order to the keys 
     specified in --extra-post-meta-keys.
     
    [--skip-categories]
     If set categories will not be imported
    	
	[--skip-tags]
